## You're Booked! App 
### your a private, web based reading tracker 
---
I am a pretty avid reader with a terrible memory. I used to use Goodreads to track what books I had read, when I started reading them, when I finished them, and a quick rating. 
I found the social aspects of Goodreads to be really distracting -- the petty infighting in reviews, the authors constantly shilling their latest book -- and switched to using a locally saved spreadsheet. 
Using a spreadsheet saved to your computer to track your reading is less than ideal because: 
1. You can only use it on your computer, and 
2. It's an enormous spreadsheet with all kinds of data on it and I just **keep** adding more to it. 

When the second SEI project was building a CRUD application, I knew immediately what I wanted to do -- a private, web based reading tracker! It solves all my issues with the spreadsheet, AND it's mobile. 
What a win!
